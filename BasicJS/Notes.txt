CREATION PHASE-----------------------------EXECUTION PHASE
 1. in creation phase --
 a. create Global or window object
 b it setups a memory heap for storing variable and function references.
 c.it initializes those variable declaration and functions with undefined.

         a=undefined, multiply(){body}, b=undefined
 
2.Execution phase
 - js executes the code line by line.
 - assigning the values to variables and executes the function call.
 - also for every new function created javascript engine create a new 
 execution context all together.
