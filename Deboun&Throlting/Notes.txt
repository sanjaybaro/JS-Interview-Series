#Debouncing and Throttling:

- Debouncing:
delay for 400 ms,
-it limits the execution of a function call,
and waits for a certain amount of time before
running it again.in this case it is 400 ms.


eg:flipkart search box.
typing gap greater than 400ms < then API call.



-Throttling
eg: Throttling action in scrolling web page.
api call in a specific time period again and again, 
not every time.it will execute function in each 
certain period of time.

-Throttling is a technique to limit the execution of an event 
handler function even when this event trigger continuously
due to user action. user action here is scrolling.
